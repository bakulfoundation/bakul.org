                                    <p>There have been major concerns of the incidence of Covid increasing in winter. This is because winter has always been risky for people with respiratory diseases and Covid 19 is actually SARS Covid 2, i.e. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. This risk is higher in urban areas, where the pollution is more, ventilation is less and trees are fewer. Moreover, in winter, the polluting particulate matter such as nitrogen dioxide remains suspended longer.</p>
                                    <p>Trees and natural greenery have an important role as they sequester carbon and other pollutants and release oxygen. It is scientifically claimed that an average tree sequesters about 1 tonne of carbon in its lifetime. But in winter, they become less effective as they shed leaves. There have been significant researches establishing the role of trees in reducing respiratory diseases. The first major nation-wide study in the US by the US Forest Service scientists calculated that trees save 850 human lives a year and prevent 670,000 incidences of acute respiratory symptoms. In New York City alone, trees were supposed to save about 10 lives a year. The study proved conclusively that trees make the city healthier let alone address climate change and give us shade.</p>
                                    <p>Therefore, this Diwali, in the midst of this pandemic, BAKUL FOUNDATION has renewed its 11 year old campaign to gift plants with greater urgency. "We give gifts to show that we care for the other person, and there cannot be a better way to show we care during this pandemic than by gifting a plant"</p>

                                    <p>As the name suggests, the aim of this campaign has been to promote a cultural relationship with trees through a personal bond and not an impersonal act of mere plantation, which leads to hundreds of thousands of trees getting planted each year only to be abandoned. Moreover, the thought of how a simple act by an ordinary individual can have a viral impact, made us think of the practice of gifting plants.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    
                                    <p>Further, in an age of instruction overdose, the act of gifting plants gives the message of the need to plant trees even if no words are spoken. In fact, it gives responsibility to the recipient to plant the tree and nurture it.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    
                                    <p>Hence, the campaign promotes the practice of gifting plants on occasions such as birthdays, weddings, child birth or any occasion in which we give gifts. The campaign goes a step further and has as its punchline, "But you don't need a reason to gift a tree".</p>

                                    <p>The campaign is primarily on social media with hundreds of people becoming ambassadors with profile pictures relating to the campaign. These images are further developed into posters and hoardings and the campaign runs on radio as well. There is also a Green Superhero, Dedi Loku (Tree Man in the Kui tribal language), who is the mascot of the campaign.</p>

                                    <p>After running the My Tree Campaign for a few years, we realized that even if people were motivated to gift trees, at the time of purchase of the gift (often just before gifting), it was not easy to get a tree in the first place, let alone package it. This is because most people don't know where the nurseries are and they are not conveniently located either, and the nurseries are not open in the evenings, when people buy their gifts.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Hence, Bakul decided to come up with attractive packaged gift plants as a solution for those who are interested but find it difficult to gift plants in Bhubaneswar. Acknowledging the challenge, many face of planting trees if they are staying in apartments, Bakul decided to offer 3 varieties of plants:
                                        <ul type=a>
                                            <li>tree growing species like Mango, Neem, Bakul</li>
                                            <li>medicinal plants (potted variety) such as Tulsi, Brahmi, etc</li>
                                            <li>flowering plants such as roses, petunia, marigold etc</li>
                                        </ul> 
                                        These Gift Plants are also available in 2 kinds of attractive packaging, in a basket or a fabric package.
                                    </p>
                                    <br>
                                    
                                    <p>Bakul Gift Plants are slowly becoming popular, and have been purchased by individuals and organizations such as NHRD, SBI, Odisha Diary at events, at award functions, as return gifts at parties etc.</p>

                                    <p>This started when Bakul was approached by One Drop, an international NGO, to work on Education on Water and Sanitation using the Arts in villages of Ganjam. It seemed a wonderful opportunity to work outside Bhubaneswar and to bring together the three interests of Bakul in Education, Environment and the Arts.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    
                                    <p>Hence, Bakul designed an innovative intervention in which Education happened by the villagers instead of for the villagers, seeing the villagers as active agents of educational activities and not as mere recepients of higher knowledge. And the education happened through a larger festival of learning, which made them trust the Bakul team. This also happened because the team camped in a village for 6 days instead of merely visiting them and "educating" them.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    
                                    <p>Moreover, though the objective was awareness on WASH, there was a Mobile Library for the 6 days and Film Screenings in the evenings. So, at the end, people thought that the team had come for their good. And for the 6 days,  there was a festival of learning in which the villagers created stories, acted in plays, painted murals or created sculptures, made films etc. each of which ended up creating awareness on water and sanitation. But in this case, the villagers themselves owned the awareness activities as they had created them.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    
                                    <p>After the partnership with One Drop, Bakul has partnered with UNICEF in creating awareness on Water and Sanitation among pilgrims at the massive Nabakalebara celebrations in Puri in 2015. Again with UNICEF, Bakul is running a WASH in Schools project currently in Angul District.</p>

                                    <p>Because Bakul promotes individuals becoming change agents, education about the environment and how we are causing problems because of modern lifestyles is very important if individuals are to change from being problems to being the solutions.</p>
