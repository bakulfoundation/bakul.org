                    True, we are registered as a society and are, therefore, an NGO. But we work in a way that is very
                    different to most NGOs. For us, Bakul is not an organization; it is an idea, an idea of what can
                    happen when we come together. It is also a movement because only a movement can bring about
                    substantial change. Therefore, anyone present anywhere can become a part of Bakul. We are not a
                    fixed group of people. We keep growing and evolving and we want to grow further in terms of having
                    more of you with us. There is no Membership Fee or Mandatory Requirements.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Unlike most other NGOs, we are not just interested in doing good work. What we are interested in is
                    how we can inspire many more people to do the good work with us. Wanting to mobilize others puts the
                    pressure on us of doing excellent and inspirational selfless work. Moreover, if we do not do good
                    work and are not proud of the work we are doing, we will not remain with Bakul ourselves. The
                    easiest thing for a volunteer is to exit.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    To inspire more and more people to volunteer, we try and demonstrate what is achievable entirely
                    through volunteerism. For instance, our children’s library. For us, Bakul is a platform where people
                    like-minded people like us can come together. Therefore, if you have an idea for how society or some
                    section of it can benefit from your volunteerism, at Bakul, you could mobilize people around you
                    from among us and together we could make it happen.

                <p>
                    We started out with three of us, Sujit, Satyajit and Ayusman launching a library movement in Odisha
                    with a campaign, DONATE BOOKS: BUILD A LIBRARY (Link to www.pledgebank.com/bakul-library) on 1st
                    April 2006. We took the name of BAKUL after the name of a tree found in abundance in Eastern India.
                    In Odisha where we began, it is suggestive of a legacy as well. The Founding Fathers of the state
                    such as Gopabandhu Das had started a school in a Bakul Van (Bakul grove). Thus, the tree becomes a
                    symbol of what can happen with minimal resources. At the same time the idea behind the school was
                    not merely to teach students, but to create the future leaders of the state. Our mission to spread
                    the virus of volunteerism takes inspiration from that initiative a century back and we decided to
                    take the name from there. At the time of launching the pledge, BAKUL was not registered, nor was it
                    in the process of being registered.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    BAKUL was only an idea and it existed only on the internet. We began with a blog (that has become
                    dysfunctional)and an on-line campaign at www.pledgebank.com/bakul-library with our own pledge to set
                    up a Children's Library in Bhubaneswar on 1st April 2007 if 1000 individuals also pledged to
                    contribute. Meanwhile, during the course of the campaign, BAKUL was registered as an organization
                    from among those who had pledged for the campaign. We also organized Film Festivals at IIM Bangalore
                    and Delhi University as an excuse to bring people together, where we could talk about our idea of
                    BAKUL and mobilize support.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    An Indian student group called UDAI at the University of Waterloo in Canada, got excited by our
                    campaign and mobilized 3000 books for our endeavor.

                <b>Who is a Volunteer?</b>
                <p>A volunteer for us is one, who works for social and environmental development without any material
                    benefits or salary.</p>
                <br>
                <b>Why Bakul or why a movement for volunteerism?</b>
                <p>The founding of Bakul in Orissa had 3 main provocations Individuals wanted change but were cynical
                    about it and about their capability to bring about that change because they could only make small
                    contributions. They, therefore, did little to bring about that change as well. The mistaken notion
                    that change could happen only through big funding as if public participation was not needed. The
                    public that wanted to participate, on the other hand, did not have a credible platform that
                    generated trust for people to contribute. Our perception was that a major chunk of people from India
                    and Orissa in particular wanted to give back to society. Most people did not trust NGOs and believed
                    NGOs existed to make money. NGOs made little effort to engage volunteers as well. For instance,
                    after the Volunteer Fair 2008 in Bhubaneswar jointly organized by VSO and Bakul, most of the NGOs
                    apart from Bakul did not really engage the young people interested in volunteering. With Bakul,
                    however, though more than 200 had signed up, atleast 30 actively volunteered in the last few months
                    and have brought in more of their friends. Therefore, the mission of Bakul is bring about an
                    attitudinal change in individuals that makes them active citizens and this can only happen through a
                    movement.</p>
                <br>
                <b>What is the Bakul Model of Intervention?</b>
                <p>Bakul works on a model of what we call “Volunteer Capitalism”. The Volunteers at Bakul and the spirit
                    of volunteerism in the work of Bakul inspires and brings more people to volunteer. Like capital
                    attracts more capital, the volunteers of Bakul attract more volunteers. In its two and a half years
                    of existence, more than 2000 individuals have been actively involved. It started with the pledge
                    campaign itself. The benefit of an online campaign was, as people saw that many more people like
                    them had pledged, they felt motivated to get involved and made them also believe in the possibility
                    of its success. We call a volunteer Bakulized not when she is extremely enthusiastic about Bakul.
                    For us, a volunteer cannot be Bakulized unless she Bakulizes others.</p>
                <br>
                <b>What are our Limitations and Challenges?</b>
                <p>Like all romantic things, volunteerism has its own challenges.

                    The biggest challenge is the high volunteer turnover. Many volunteers join Bakul, work passionately
                    and do great work, but then soon enough, they leave.

                    That is why, there is often a challenge of consistency.

                    Often the learning and expertise the volunteers acquire in the course of their volunteering does not
                    stay with Bakul in the absence of many permanent volunteers.

                    The success of volunteerism is its greatest challenge also. Seeing the work of Bakul, many people
                    have very high expectations but Bakul may not have the human resources to fulfill those expectations
                    since the volunteers keep moving.

                    The platform that Bakul provides for people to come together to translate their ideas into reality
                    is romantic. But for every idea that is taken up, many other ideas cannot be taken up because there
                    are not enough people.

                    Sometimes there are people ready to volunteer, but we may not have mentors to guide them.</p>
